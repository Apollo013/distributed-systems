# Kafka Message Brokering

We have 2 maven projects. The first is a Kafka Producer Broker and the second a Consumer service.

You will need to have Kafka installed locally first. Use the property files in the config folder to help you get setup.

### Scope

1. Message Producing and sending
2. Topic partitioning
3. Consuming messages
4. Load balancing
5. Publish / Subscribe pattern
6. Consumer commit failure
