Apache ZooKeeper is a distributed coordination service that provides a centralized infrastructure for managing and synchronizing distributed systems. It is an open-source project maintained by the Apache Software Foundation. ZooKeeper is designed to help with the coordination and management of distributed applications, ensuring that they operate effectively and consistently.

Key features and functions of Apache ZooKeeper include:

1. Coordination: ZooKeeper provides a reliable and distributed environment for coordinating distributed applications. It helps in managing tasks like leader election, distributed locks, and configuration management.

2. Consistency: ZooKeeper maintains a consistent view of the system across all nodes. It uses a consensus algorithm (ZAB - ZooKeeper Atomic Broadcast) to ensure that updates are applied in a consistent and ordered manner.

3. Synchronization: Distributed applications often need synchronization among nodes to ensure that they operate in a coherent manner. ZooKeeper provides primitives like barriers and locks for achieving synchronization.

4. Notification: Clients can register to receive notifications about changes in the system. This feature is useful for building event-driven applications and responding to dynamic changes in a distributed environment.

5. Hierarchical Namespace: ZooKeeper organizes data in a hierarchical namespace, similar to a file system. Each node in the namespace is called a znode, and it can store data and metadata.

6. Fault Tolerance: ZooKeeper is designed to be highly available and fault-tolerant. It can withstand the failure of a subset of nodes while continuing to provide services.

7. Scalability: It can be used in large-scale distributed systems, providing scalability to accommodate a growing number of nodes and clients.

ZooKeeper is commonly used in various distributed systems and frameworks, such as Apache Hadoop, Apache Kafka, and Apache HBase, to manage coordination and synchronization tasks. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the reliability and consistency of these distributed applications.
